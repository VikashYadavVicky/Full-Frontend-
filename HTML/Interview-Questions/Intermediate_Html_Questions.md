## ðŸ”· Intermediate HTML Interview Questions and Answers (Short & Long)

### âœ… Questions 1â€“20

1. **What is semantic HTML?**  
   - **Answer:** Semantic HTML uses HTML5 tags that convey meaning about the content inside them, such as `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>`. These improve accessibility, SEO, and code readability.

2. **How does the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` tag improve form accessibility?**  
   - **Answer:** `<fieldset>` groups related elements, and `<legend>` gives a caption to that group. Screen readers use these to provide better context for users with disabilities.

3. **What is the difference between `<div>` and `<section>`?**  
   - **Answer:** `<div>` is a generic container with no semantic meaning. `<section>` represents a standalone block of related content and should ideally have a heading.

4. **How is the `<details>` tag used in HTML5?**  
   - **Answer:** The `<details>` tag is used to create a collapsible content block. It is often paired with the `<summary>` tag to define the visible summary.

5. **What is the purpose of the `aria-*` attributes in HTML?**  
   - **Answer:** ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes improve accessibility by providing additional context to assistive technologies like screen readers.

6. **Explain the difference between `<strong>` and `<b>`.**  
   - **Answer:** `<strong>` adds importance (semantic emphasis) to text, while `<b>` simply makes text bold without semantic meaning.

7. **What does the `contenteditable` attribute do?**  
   - **Answer:** When set to `true`, it makes an element editable by the user directly in the browser.

8. **How is the `<template>` tag used in HTML?**  
   - **Answer:** It holds reusable HTML code fragments that are not rendered until activated via JavaScript. Useful for client-side rendering.

9. **What is the difference between `<input type="button">` and `<button>`?**  
   - **Answer:** `<input type="button">` is self-closing and canâ€™t have child elements. `<button>` is more flexible as it can include text, HTML, or images inside it.

10. **How does HTML5 handle audio and video elements?**  
    - **Answer:** HTML5 introduced `<audio>` and `<video>` tags that support native playback without plugins. Attributes like `controls`, `autoplay`, and `loop` enhance functionality.

11. **Explain the difference between `defer` and `async` script loading.**  
    - **Answer:** `defer` delays script execution until after HTML parsing is complete. `async` executes the script as soon as it is downloaded, potentially interrupting parsing.

12. **What is a polyfill in the context of HTML?**  
    - **Answer:** A polyfill is a piece of JavaScript code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not support it natively.

13. **Why should we avoid inline styling in HTML?**  
    - **Answer:** Inline styles mix content with presentation, making code harder to maintain and override. It's better to use external CSS for separation of concerns.

14. **What is the purpose of the `hidden` attribute?**  
    - **Answer:** It hides the element from view without removing it from the DOM. Useful for toggling visibility with JavaScript.

15. **How can you make a form field required?**  
    - **Answer:** By adding the `required` attribute to input elements, browsers will prevent form submission if the field is empty.

16. **What is the difference between `<article>` and `<section>`?**  
    - **Answer:** `<article>` is for self-contained content like blog posts, while `<section>` is for grouping related content. Articles can be standalone; sections often need context.

17. **What are void elements in HTML?**  
    - **Answer:** Void elements do not have closing tags or content, such as `<br>`, `<img>`, `<input>`, and `<hr>`.

18. **What is the `<output>` element used for?**  
    - **Answer:** It represents the result of a calculation or user action, often used with JavaScript or forms.

19. **Explain the difference between `<label for="id">` and placing the `<input>` inside the `<label>`.**  
    - **Answer:** Both are valid. Using `for` links the label to the input via `id`. Nesting places the input inside the label for implicit association.

20. **How can you make an image responsive in HTML?**  
    - **Answer:** By setting the `width` to `100%` and `height` to `auto` via CSS or using `picture` and `srcset` for adaptive images.

### âœ… Questions 21â€“40

   - **Answer:** `<figure>` groups media content (like images or charts), and `<figcaption>` adds a caption to describe it.

24. **How is the `autocomplete` attribute used in forms?**  
   - **Answer:** It controls whether the browser should auto-fill the input field based on previous entries. Values: `on` or `off`.

25. **What are custom data attributes in HTML5?**  
   - **Answer:** Attributes prefixed with `data-`, e.g., `data-id="123"`, store extra data for use in JavaScript without affecting layout or behavior.

26. **What does the `<mark>` element do?**  
   - **Answer:** It highlights text by applying a yellow background to indicate relevance or search result match.

   - **Answer:** It controls the order of focus when using the Tab key for navigation, improving accessibility and keyboard usability.

35. **Explain Shadow DOM in the context of HTML.**  
   - **Answer:** Shadow DOM allows encapsulation of DOM and styles, letting you hide internal implementation of custom elements from the main document.

36. **What does the `draggable` attribute do?**  
   - **Answer:** It enables drag-and-drop functionality for an element when set to `true`.

37. **How do you define a base URL for all relative links in a document?**  
   - **Answer:** Use the `<base href="https://example.com/">` tag inside the `<head>` section.

38. **What is the role of the `<time>` element?**  
   - **Answer:** It represents a specific time or duration, useful for events, schedules, or machine-readable timestamps.

39. **What is the difference between inline and block elements in HTML?**
