# üî• 100 Advanced CSS Q&A (Short/Long)

### 1. **What is the difference between `visibility: hidden` and `display: none` in CSS?**
- **Answer:** `visibility: hidden` hides the element but keeps its space in the layout. `display: none` hides the element and removes it from the layout flow entirely.

### 2. **Explain the difference between `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky` positioning.**
