## ðŸš€ 100 Intermediate JavaScript Q\&A (Short/Long)

### 1. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * `==` checks for value equality with type coercion.
  * `===` checks for both value and type equality (strict equality).

### 2. **Explain closures in JavaScript.**

* **Answer:**

  * A closure is created when an inner function has access to the outer function's variables, even after the outer function has returned. Closures preserve the scope chain.

### 3. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope before execution.

### 4. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**

* **Answer:**

  * `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared.
  * `let` is block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared.
  * `const` is block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared.

### 5. **What is the 'this' keyword in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * `this` refers to the context in which a function is executed. In global scope, it's the window object (in browsers). In objects, it refers to the object itself.

### 6. **What are arrow functions and how are they different from regular functions?**

* **Answer:**

  * Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing functions. They do not have their own `this`, arguments, super, or new\.target.

### 7. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous callbacks by pushing them from the message queue to the call stack when itâ€™s empty.

### 8. **What are promises and why are they used?**

* **Answer:**

  * Promises are used for handling asynchronous operations. They represent a value that may be available now, later, or never.

### 9. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?**

* **Answer:**

  * Synchronous code runs sequentially. Asynchronous code runs independently and doesn't block subsequent code execution.

### 10. **What is the purpose of `async` and `await`?**

* **Answer:**

  * `async` defines a function that returns a promise. `await` pauses the execution until the promise resolves, making asynchronous code look synchronous.

### 11. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**

* **Answer:**

  * `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned. `null` is an assignment value that represents no value.

### 12. **What is a callback function in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument and is executed after the parent function completes.

### 13. **What are template literals in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions using backticks (\`\`) and `${}` for interpolation.

### 14. **What are JavaScript data types?**

* **Answer:**

  * Primitive types: String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Symbol, Null. Reference types: Object, Array, Function.

### 15. **What is destructuring in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

### 16. **How does the `spread` operator work?**

* **Answer:**

  * The spread operator (`...`) expands iterable elements like arrays or strings into individual elements.

### 17. **What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?**

* **Answer:**

  * An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined, typically wrapped in `()` and followed by another `()`.

### 18. **What is the purpose of `try...catch` in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * It handles errors gracefully during execution. `try` contains code to run, and `catch` handles exceptions.

### 19. **What are higher-order functions in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

### 20. **What is the difference between `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`?**

* **Answer:**

  * `map()` transforms each array element.
  * `filter()` selects elements based on a condition.
  * `reduce()` reduces the array to a single value based on logic.


### 21. **What is the purpose of `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`?**

* **Answer:**

  * Constructor Function (`new Function()`)

### 23. **What is function currying?**

* **Answer:**

  * Currying is the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take one argument.

### 24. **Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance.**

* **Answer:**

  * In JavaScript, objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype chain. This allows shared behavior through the prototype object.

### 25. **What is the difference between `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()`?**

* **Answer:**

  * `Object.freeze()` makes an object immutable.
  * `Object.seal()` prevents adding/removing properties but allows changing existing ones.

### 26. **What is the use of the `bind()` method?**

* **Answer:**

  * `bind()` creates a new function with `this` bound to a specific object, useful in callbacks and event handlers.

### 27. **What is event delegation in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Event delegation allows handling events at a higher-level parent element instead of attaching listeners to individual children.

### 28. **How can you deep clone an object in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Methods: `structuredClone(obj)` (modern), `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` (basic), or using libraries like Lodash's `cloneDeep()`.

### 31. **What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?**

* **Answer:**

  * Shallow copy copies only references of nested objects.
  * Deep copy recursively copies all levels of data, ensuring independence.

### 32. **What is the difference between `call()` and `apply()`?**

* **Answer:**

  * Both invoke functions with a specified `this` value.
  * `call()` passes arguments individually, `apply()` passes them as an array.

### 33. **What is a generator function?**

* **Answer:**

  * A generator is a special function that can pause execution (`yield`) and resume later. Defined with `function*`.

### 34. **How do you detect an array in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Use `Array.isArray(value)` to check if a value is an array.

### 35. **What is the difference between `slice()` and `splice()`?**

* **Answer:**

  * `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
  * `splice()` changes the original array by removing or adding elements.

### 36. **What is memoization?**

### 39. **What is the use of `encodeURIComponent()`?**

* **Answer:**

  * It encodes a URI component by escaping special characters for safe transmission in a URL.

### 40. **How do modules work in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Modules let you import and export reusable code. ES6 uses `import/export` syntax, while CommonJS uses `require/module.exports`.

### 41. **What are the differences between `for...in` and `for...of` loops?**

* **Answer:**

  * `for...in` iterates over enumerable properties (keys) of an object.
  * `for...of` iterates over iterable values like arrays, strings, maps, etc.

### 42. **What is the temporal dead zone (TDZ) in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * TDZ is the period between entering a block and initializing `let`/`const` where accessing them throws a ReferenceError.

### 43. **How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations under the hood?**

* **Answer:**

  * JavaScript uses an event loop, call stack, and callback queue to manage async tasks, with Web APIs handling operations like setTimeout.

### 44. **What is the difference between rest and spread operators?**

* **Answer:**

  * Rest (`...`) collects remaining elements into an array.
  * Spread (`...`) expands elements from an array or object.

### 45. **How does JavaScript handle memory management?**

* **Answer:**

  * JavaScript uses automatic garbage collection. It tracks memory allocation and frees memory that's no longer reachable.

### 46. **What are weak references in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Weak references (like in `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`) allow referencing objects without preventing garbage collection.

### 47. **What is the call stack in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * The call stack is a data structure used by the JS engine to track function calls. Functions are pushed and popped as they are called and returned.

### 48. **Explain the concept of throttling and debouncing.**

* **Answer:**

  * Throttling limits the execution of a function to once every X ms.
  * Debouncing delays execution until X ms have passed since the last invocation.

### 49. **What is the role of the `new` keyword in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * The `new` keyword creates a new instance of a constructor function, setting up inheritance and `this` context.

### 50. **What is the difference between class and prototype inheritance?**

* **Answer:**

  * Class inheritance uses ES6 `class` syntax and is syntactic sugar over prototype inheritance, which uses objects linked via prototypes.

  * It enforces stricter parsing and error handling in your code, preventing some silent errors and unsafe actions.

### 57. **What is an event loop tick?**

* **Answer:**

  * A tick is one cycle of the event loop. During each tick, the loop checks the queue and executes callbacks if the call stack is empty.

### 58. **How does JavaScript handle blocking and non-blocking code?**

* **Answer:**

  * Blocking code prevents further execution until it finishes. Non-blocking (async) code uses callbacks/promises to execute later.

### 59. **What is dynamic typing in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables can hold any type, and types can change at runtime.

### 60. **What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?**

* **Answer:**

  * Function declarations are hoisted, while expressions are not. Declarations define a named function; expressions can be anonymous and assigned to variables.

### 61. **What is the difference between `undefined` and not defined in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
  * Not defined means a variable hasnâ€™t been declared at all, and accessing it causes a ReferenceError.

### 62. **How does the `typeof` operator work in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the operand. E.g., `typeof 42` returns "number".

### 63. **What is the event bubbling and capturing in the DOM?**

* **Answer:**

  * Bubbling: Event propagates from target element up to the root.
  * Capturing: Event propagates from root down to the target.

### 64. **What are the different ways to handle events in JavaScript?**

* **Answer:**

  * Using `addEventListener()`, setting `onclick`, inline HTML handlers, and jQuery (if used).

### 65. **What is the difference between `innerHTML`, `innerText`, and `textContent`?**

* **Answer:**

  * `innerHTML`: Gets/sets HTML markup.
  * `innerText`: Gets/sets visible text (respecting styling).
  * `textContent`: Gets/sets all text, regardless of style.

### 66. **What is the DOM?**

* **Answer:**

  * DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like structure representing the content of a web page as objects.

### 67. **How do you prevent event propagation in JavaScript?**

### 71. **How do you handle errors in Promises?**

* **Answer:**

  * Use `.catch()` for error handling or wrap with `try...catch` in async/await.

### 72. **What is `nullish coalescing operator (??)`?**

* **Answer:**

  * Returns the right-hand operand if the left-hand operand is `null` or `undefined`.

### 73. **What is optional chaining (`?.`) in JavaScript?**
